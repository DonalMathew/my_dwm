Yes, you can control the fan speed and profile of your **Asus Zenbook** in Linux, but it may require a combination of tools and manual configuration, depending on the hardware support. Here are a few methods you can try to manage and control the fan profile on your Asus Zenbook:

### Method 1: Using `asus-fan-control`
`asus-fan-control` is a tool developed specifically for Asus laptops, allowing you to control fan speed on Linux.

1. **Install `asus-fan-control`**:
   - First, install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install git build-essential
     ```

   - Clone the `asus-fan-control` repository and build it:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/dominiksalvet/asus-fan-control.git
     cd asus-fan-control
     sudo make install
     ```

2. **Check Available Fan Modes**:
   - Run the following command to list available fan modes:
     ```bash
     sudo asus-fan-control get-available-profiles
     ```

3. **Set a Fan Profile**:
   - You can set a specific fan profile with this command:
     ```bash
     sudo asus-fan-control set-mode normal
     ```
   - Available profiles may include `silent`, `normal`, and `performance`.

4. **Enable at Boot (Optional)**:
   - To ensure the settings persist after reboot, you can create a systemd service or add the profile setting command to your startup script.

### Method 2: Using `fancontrol` and `lm-sensors`
If `asus-fan-control` does not work for your laptop model, you can use **`fancontrol`** in combination with **`lm-sensors`** to manage fan speed manually.

1. **Install `lm-sensors` and `fancontrol`**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install lm-sensors fancontrol
   ```

2. **Detect Sensors**:
   - Run the following command to detect available sensors (including fan sensors):
     ```bash
     sudo sensors-detect
     ```
   - Accept the defaults by pressing Enter and allow the script to detect available hardware sensors.

3. **Check Fan Sensors**:
   - After the sensors are detected, run the following command to see the temperature and fan speed data:
     ```bash
     sensors
     ```

4. **Configure Fan Control**:
   - To configure fancontrol, run the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo pwmconfig
     ```
   - This will guide you through configuring fan speed profiles based on temperature thresholds. Follow the instructions to adjust fan speed behavior according to temperature.

5. **Enable Fancontrol**:
   - Start and enable the fancontrol service so it automatically applies your settings:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl enable fancontrol
     sudo systemctl start fancontrol
     ```

### Method 3: Using `nbfc` (Notebook Fan Control)
If the previous methods don’t work, **`nbfc`** (Notebook Fan Control) is another option that supports many laptop models, including Asus.

1. **Install `nbfc`**:
   - Clone and install `nbfc` from the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc.git
     cd nbfc
     sudo ./install.sh
     ```

2. **List Available Profiles**:
   - Check if a fan profile exists for your laptop model:
     ```bash
     sudo nbfc list
     ```

3. **Set the Profile**:
   - If there’s a profile for your Asus Zenbook, apply it:
     ```bash
     sudo nbfc set -a "profile-name"
     ```

4. **Start NBFC**:
   - Start `nbfc` and enable it to run at startup:
     ```bash
     sudo nbfc start
     sudo systemctl enable nbfc
     ```

### Method 4: BIOS Settings
Some Asus laptops allow you to control fan profiles from the BIOS/UEFI.

1. **Reboot your laptop** and enter the BIOS/UEFI settings (usually by pressing `F2` or `DEL` during boot).
2. **Look for fan settings** under the advanced or hardware options.
3. **Select a different fan profile** (silent, normal, performance, etc.).

### Conclusion
To control your fan profile on Linux for an Asus Zenbook:

- **Try `asus-fan-control`** for fan management specific to Asus laptops.
- **Use `fancontrol` and `lm-sensors`** for more manual control.
- **Explore `nbfc`** if other tools don’t work.
- Check the **BIOS/UEFI settings** for built-in fan control options.

If none of these tools work for your specific model, your hardware may not fully support fan control via software, but it's worth trying these options first.
