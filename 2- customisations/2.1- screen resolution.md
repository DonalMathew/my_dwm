For high-resolution displays like a 2K screen, the default font size and other UI elements can appear very small in dwm. Here's how you can adjust the font size and scaling:

### Increasing Font Size in dwm

1. **Edit `config.h`**:
   - Open the `config.h` file in the dwm source directory:
     ```sh
     nano config.h
     ```

2. **Change the Font Size**:
   - Look for the line that sets the default font. It usually looks like this:
     ```c
     static const char *fonts[] = { "monospace:size=10" };
     ```
   - Increase the font size by changing the number. For example, to set the font size to 14:
     ```c
     static const char *fonts[] = { "monospace:size=14" };
     ```

3. **Recompile dwm**:
   - After making the change, recompile and reinstall dwm:
     ```sh
     sudo make clean install
     ```

### Setting Up DPI for X11

To ensure the entire X session is scaled correctly, set the DPI (dots per inch) setting:

1. **Edit `.Xresources`**:
   - Create or edit the `.Xresources` file in your home directory:
     ```sh
     nano ~/.Xresources
     ```

2. **Add DPI Setting**:
   - Add the following line to set the DPI. Adjust the value as needed; 144 is a common choice for 2K displays:
     ```sh
     Xft.dpi: 144
     ```

3. **Apply the Changes**:
   - Apply the changes immediately:
     ```sh
     xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
     ```

### Scaling Other Applications

Some applications may need additional configuration to scale properly:

1. **GTK Applications**:
   - Create or edit `~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini` and add:
     ```ini
     [Settings]
     gtk-font-name = Sans 14
     gtk-dpi = 144
     ```

2. **QT Applications**:
   - Set the environment variable for QT scaling:
     ```sh
     echo "export QT_SCALE_FACTOR=1.5" >> ~/.xsession
     ```

### Restart dwm

After making these changes, restart dwm to see the effect. You can log out and log back in, or restart your system.

These steps should help make everything more readable on your 2K screen. If you need further adjustments or run into any issues, feel free to ask!
