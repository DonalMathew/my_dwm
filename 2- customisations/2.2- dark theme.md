For me, changing the theme of gtk-applications was enough. 

### Editing `config.h` for a Dark Theme

1. **Open `config.h`**:

   - Navigate to the dwm source directory and open the `config.h` file:

     ```sh
     cd path/to/dwm/source
     nano config.h
     ```

2. **Modify the Color Scheme**:

   - Locate the section in `config.h` that defines colors. It usually looks like this:

     ```c
     static const char col_gray1[]       = "#222222";
     static const char col_gray2[]       = "#444444";
     static const char col_gray3[]       = "#bbbbbb";
     static const char col_gray4[]       = "#eeeeee";
     static const char col_cyan[]        = "#005577";
     static const char *colors[][3]      = {
         /*               fg         bg         border   */
         [SchemeNorm] = { col_gray3, col_gray1, col_gray2 },
         [SchemeSel]  = { col_gray4, col_cyan,  col_cyan  },
     };
     ```

3. **Set Dark Colors**:

   - Update the color definitions to use darker colors. Here is an example for a dark theme:

     ```c
     static const char col_gray1[]       = "#1c1c1c"; // Background color
     static const char col_gray2[]       = "#444444"; // Inactive window border color
     static const char col_gray3[]       = "#c0c0c0"; // Font color
     static const char col_gray4[]       = "#ffffff"; // Current tag and current window font color
     static const char col_cyan[]        = "#005577"; // Top bar second color and active window border color
     static const char *colors[][3]      = {
         /*               fg         bg         border   */
         [SchemeNorm] = { col_gray3, col_gray1, col_gray2 },
         [SchemeSel]  = { col_gray4, col_cyan,  col_cyan  },
     };
     ```

4. **Recompile dwm**:

   - After making the changes, recompile and install dwm:

     ```sh
     sudo make clean install
     ```

### Additional Customization

If you use other applications that also need to switch to a dark theme, you might need to adjust their settings as well:

1. **GTK Applications**:

   - For GTK applications, you can set the GTK theme to a dark theme:

     ```sh
     nano ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
     ```
   - Add or update the following lines:

     ```ini
     [Settings]
     gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme = true
     ```

2. **QT Applications**:

   - For QT applications, you can set the QT theme to a dark theme by exporting an environment variable:

     ```sh
     echo "export QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=Adwaita-Dark" >> ~/.xsession
     ```

3. **Reload Configuration**:

   - After making these changes, restart dwm to apply the new theme. You can log out and log back in, or restart your system.

These steps should help you switch dwm to a dark theme. If you need more specific customization or run into any issues, feel free to ask!
