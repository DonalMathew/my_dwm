**mod+b** keybinding will toggle the status bar. If you need additional customisations, keep reading.

### Toggle the Status Bar with a Keybinding

1. **Edit `config.h`**:

   - Open the `config.h` file in the dwm source directory:

     ```sh
     cd path/to/dwm/source
     nano config.h
     ```

2. **Add a Keybinding to Toggle the Status Bar**:

   - Find the section that defines keybindings. It usually looks like this:

     ```c
     static Key keys[] = {
         /* modifier                     key        function        argument */
         { MODKEY,                       XK_b,      togglebar,      {0} },
         // Other keybindings...
     };
     ```
   - The `MODKEY + b` keybinding is typically used to toggle the status bar. Ensure it is present:

     ```c
     { MODKEY,                       XK_b,      togglebar,      {0} },
     ```

3. **Recompile dwm**:

   - After making the changes, recompile and install dwm:

     ```sh
     sudo make clean install
     ```

### Start dwm Without the Status Bar

If you want dwm to start without displaying the status bar by default, you need to modify the `showbar` variable in `config.h`:

1. **Edit `config.h`**:

   - Open the `config.h` file:

     ```sh
     cd path/to/dwm/source
     nano config.h
     ```

2. **Set `showbar` to 0**:

   - Locate the `showbar` variable and set it to 0:

     ```c
     static int showbar = 0;  /* 0 means no bar */
     ```

3. **Recompile dwm**:

   - After making the change, recompile and install dwm:

     ```sh
     sudo make clean install
     ```

### Reload dwm

After recompiling, restart dwm to apply the changes. You can log out and log back in, or restart your system.

With these configurations, you can toggle the status bar using `MODKEY + b`, and if desired, start dwm without displaying the status bar by default. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
