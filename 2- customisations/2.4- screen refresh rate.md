To change the refresh rate of your screen in Linux, you can use the `xrandr` command. Here are the steps to do it:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Check Available Refresh Rates**:
   - Open a terminal and run the `xrandr` command to see the available refresh rates for your display:
     ```sh
     xrandr
     ```

   - You will see an output similar to this:
     ```
     Screen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 32767 x 32767
     HDMI-1 connected primary 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 509mm x 286mm
        1920x1080     60.00*+  59.94  
        1680x1050     59.88  
        1280x1024     75.02    60.02  
        ...
     ```
   - The current resolution and refresh rate are marked with an asterisk (*). The available refresh rates are listed next to each resolution.

2. **Change the Refresh Rate**:
   - Use the `xrandr` command to change the refresh rate. For example, to set the refresh rate of your HDMI-1 display to 60Hz at a resolution of 1920x1080, you would run:
     ```sh
     xrandr --output HDMI-1 --mode 1920x1080 --rate 60
     ```

3. **Add to Startup (Optional)**:
   - If you want to apply this setting automatically on startup, you can add the `xrandr` command to your startup script (`.xinitrc`, `dwm-startup.sh`, or any other startup script you are using).

### Example for `.xinitrc` or Startup Script

Add the following line to your `.xinitrc` or `dwm-startup.sh` script:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# Set screen refresh rate
xrandr --output HDMI-1 --mode 1920x1080 --rate 60 &

# Other startup commands
nm-applet &
picom &
setxkbmap us &
xterm -e htop &

# Start dwm
exec dwm
```

### Summary

1. **Check Available Refresh Rates**:
   - Run `xrandr` to see available resolutions and refresh rates.

2. **Change the Refresh Rate**:
   - Use `xrandr --output <output> --mode <resolution> --rate <refresh_rate>`.

3. **Add to Startup (Optional)**:
   - Add the `xrandr` command to your startup script to apply the setting automatically.

### Troubleshooting

- **Identify Correct Output Name**:
  - Ensure you use the correct output name (e.g., `HDMI-1`, `eDP-1`). The output names are case-sensitive.
- **Check Supported Refresh Rates**:
  - Only use refresh rates listed by `xrandr`. Unsupported rates might not work and can cause display issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to change and set the refresh rate of your screen in Linux. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance!
