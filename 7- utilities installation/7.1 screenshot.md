>scrot has no gui and takes full screenshot, while flameshot has gui and can take cropped ss

### Step 1: Install a Screenshot Tool
You can use **scrot** (a lightweight screenshot utility) or **flameshot** (which has a GUI). Install one of them:

#### Option 1: Install **scrot**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install scrot
```

#### Option 2: Install **flameshot**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install flameshot
```

### Step 2: Bind Screenshot Key in dwm

You need to modify the **dwm config.h** file to add a keybinding for taking screenshots.

1. **Open your dwm source folder** (where you installed dwm):
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/dwm
   ```

2. **Edit the `config.h` file**:
   Open `config.h` with your preferred text editor:
   ```bash
   nano config.h
   ```

3. **Add a Keybinding**:
   Find the section where keybindings are defined, usually under the array `static Key keys[] = {`. Add a new keybinding for the screenshot tool.

   For **scrot**, you can add:
   ```c
   { MODKEY, XK_Print, spawn, SHCMD("scrot ~/Pictures/screenshot-%Y-%m-%d-%T.png") },
   ```

   For **flameshot**, you can add:
   ```c
   { MODKEY, XK_Print, spawn, SHCMD("flameshot gui") },
   ```

   Replace `MODKEY` with your modifier key (usually `Mod4Mask` for the Super key, or `Mod1Mask` for Alt) if you want a combination, or use `0` for no modifier. For example:
   ```c
   { 0, XK_Print, spawn, SHCMD("scrot ~/Pictures/screenshot-%Y-%m-%d-%T.png") },
   ```

4. **Rebuild dwm**:
   After editing `config.h`, you need to rebuild dwm to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo make clean install
   ```

5. **Restart dwm**:
   You can either log out and back in, or restart dwm by killing and restarting it:
   ```bash
   killall dwm
   ```

### Step 3: Take a Screenshot
Now, pressing the **Print Screen** key (or your chosen key combination) will take a screenshot and save it in the `~/Pictures/` folder (for scrot) or open the GUI for **flameshot**.

By setting this up, you can quickly capture screenshots with a shortcut in dwm.
