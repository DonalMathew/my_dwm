If an application window like **XMind** becomes unresponsive in **dwm**, you can forcefully close or kill the window using one of the following methods:

### Method 1: Use `xkill` to Force Close the Window

1. **Install `xkill`** if it's not already installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install x11-utils
   ```

2. **Run `xkill`**:
   In a terminal, type:
   ```bash
   xkill
   ```

3. **Click on the unresponsive window**:
   Your cursor will turn into a cross. Click the unresponsive XMind window to forcefully close it.

### Method 2: Use `xprop` to Identify and Kill the Window

1. **Find the Window ID**:
   Open a terminal and type:
   ```bash
   xprop | grep WM_CLASS
   ```
   Then click on the unresponsive XMind window. This will return some information about the window, including its class or ID.

2. **Kill the Window**:
   Use the `kill` command with the window's PID (Process ID). First, find the PID:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep xmind
   ```

   Once you find the process for XMind, use `kill` to stop it:
   ```bash
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

### Method 3: Use `pkill` to Kill the Application by Name

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to kill XMind:
   ```bash
   pkill xmind
   ```

This will forcefully close all XMind processes, freeing up the unresponsive window.

### Method 4: Restart dwm

If the window remains stuck and none of the methods work, you can restart dwm by pressing `Mod`+`Shift`+`Q` (if the keybinding is set), which will log you out and reset your session.
