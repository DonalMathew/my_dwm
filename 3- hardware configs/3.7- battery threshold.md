To limit charging to 80% using **TLP** (a Linux advanced power management tool), you need to configure the TLP settings to control battery charging. Here’s how to set it up:

### Step 1: Install TLP

If you don't already have TLP installed, run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tlp tlp-rdw
```

### Step 2: Enable TLP (if it's not already enabled)

TLP should automatically start after installation, but you can ensure it's enabled with:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable tlp
sudo systemctl start tlp
```

### Step 3: Configure TLP for Battery Charging Threshold

TLP provides settings for controlling battery charge thresholds on some laptops. However, **these settings are primarily supported on ThinkPads** (via **tp-smapi** or **acpi-call** kernel modules). If your laptop supports these modules, you can set thresholds.

1. **Install kernel modules**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install acpi-call-dkms tp-smapi-dkms
   ```

2. **Edit the TLP configuration file**:
   Open the TLP configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/tlp.conf
   ```

3. **Set the Charging Threshold**:
   Find the following section in the configuration file:

   ```bash
   # Charging thresholds (ThinkPad only)
   ```

   Uncomment and set the thresholds for **START** and **STOP** charge values to limit charging to 80%:

   ```bash
   # Battery charge thresholds (ThinkPad only)
   START_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0=75
   STOP_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0=80
   ```

   This configuration will stop charging the battery at 80% and start recharging it once the battery level drops below 75%.

4. **Save and close the file**: Press `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`.

### Step 4: Restart TLP

After configuring the file, restart TLP for the changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo tlp start
```

### Step 5: Verify Changes

You can verify if TLP is applying the settings with:

```bash
sudo tlp-stat -b
```

This will display battery information and show whether charging thresholds are applied.

**Note:** If your laptop is not a ThinkPad, you may need manufacturer-specific tools for managing charging thresholds. Check your laptop’s documentation for more information on battery management.
