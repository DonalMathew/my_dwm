To set a screen timeout of 2 minutes in dwm, you can use the `xset` command. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Method 1: Using `xset`

1. **Set Screen Timeout**:
   - Open a terminal and run the following command to set the screen timeout to 2 minutes (120 seconds):
     ```sh
     xset s 120
     ```
   - To set the display to turn off after the timeout, you can use:
     ```sh
     xset dpms 120 120 120
     ```
   - This sets the standby, suspend, and off timings to 120 seconds each.

2. **Verify the Settings**:
   - To check the current screen saver settings, run:
     ```sh
     xset q
     ```

3. **Add to Startup**:
   - To ensure this setting is applied every time you start dwm, add it to your `.xinitrc` or a startup script.

   - If you use `.xinitrc`, you can add the following lines:
     ```sh
     xset s 120 &
     xset dpms 120 120 120 &
     exec dwm
     ```

### Method 2: Using `xautolock`

`xautolock` can be used to run a command after a period of inactivity, including turning off the display.

1. **Install `xautolock`**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install xautolock
   ```

2. **Configure `xautolock`**:
   - To lock the screen after 2 minutes of inactivity, you can use:
     ```sh
     xautolock -time 2 -locker "xset dpms force off" &
     ```

3. **Add to Startup**:
   - Add the `xautolock` command to your `.xinitrc` or startup script to ensure it runs when you start dwm.
     ```sh
     xautolock -time 2 -locker "xset dpms force off" &
     exec dwm
     ```

### Method 3: Using a Custom Script

You can also create a custom script to set the screen timeout and run it at startup.

1. **Create a Script**:
   - Create a new script file, for example, `set-screen-timeout.sh`:
     ```sh
     nano ~/set-screen-timeout.sh
     ```

   - Add the following content:
     ```sh
     #!/bin/sh
     xset s 120
     xset dpms 120 120 120
     ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```sh
   chmod +x ~/set-screen-timeout.sh
   ```

3. **Add to Startup**:
   - Add the script to your `.xinitrc` or another startup configuration.
     ```sh
     ~/set-screen-timeout.sh &
     exec dwm
     ```

### Summary

- **Using `xset`**:
  - Command: `xset s 120` and `xset dpms 120 120 120`
  - Add to `.xinitrc`: `xset s 120 & xset dpms 120 120 120 & exec dwm`

- **Using `xautolock`**:
  - Command: `xautolock -time 2 -locker "xset dpms force off" &`
  - Add to `.xinitrc`: `xautolock -time 2 -locker "xset dpms force off" & exec dwm`

- **Using a Custom Script**:
  - Script: `~/set-screen-timeout.sh`
  - Add to `.xinitrc`: `~/set-screen-timeout.sh & exec dwm`
