Changing the touchpad pointer speed in dwm (or any other window manager) typically involves using `xinput` to adjust the device properties. Here's how you can do it:

### Steps to Change Touchpad Pointer Speed

1. **Identify the Touchpad Device**:
   - Open a terminal and list all input devices using:
     ```sh
     xinput list
     ```
   - Look for the touchpad device in the list. It might be named something like "SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad" or "ELAN Touchpad."

2. **Get Device Properties**:
   - Find the device ID from the output of the previous command. Let's assume it's `12` for this example.
   - List the properties of the device:
     ```sh
     xinput list-props 12
     ```
   - Look for properties related to the speed, such as "libinput Accel Speed."

3. **Adjust the Pointer Speed**:
   - To set the pointer speed, use the following command:
     ```sh
     xinput set-prop 12 "libinput Accel Speed" 0.5
     ```
   - Replace `12` with your actual device ID and `0.5` with the desired speed. The speed value typically ranges from `-1` (slowest) to `1` (fastest).

### Example Commands

Here is a practical example assuming the touchpad device ID is `12`:

1. **Identify the Touchpad**:
   ```sh
   xinput list
   ```

2. **Check Properties**:
   ```sh
   xinput list-props 12
   ```

3. **Set Pointer Speed**:
   ```sh
   xinput set-prop 12 "libinput Accel Speed" 0.5
   ```

### Making the Change Permanent

To ensure the changes persist across reboots, you can create a startup script.

1. **Create a Startup Script**:
   - Create a script, for example, `set-touchpad-speed.sh`:
     ```sh
     nano ~/set-touchpad-speed.sh
     ```

   - Add the following content, replacing `12` with your touchpad device ID and `0.5` with your desired speed:
     ```sh
     #!/bin/sh
     xinput set-prop 12 "libinput Accel Speed" 0.5
     ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```sh
   chmod +x ~/set-touchpad-speed.sh
   ```

3. **Add to .xinitrc or Autostart**:
   - If you use `.xinitrc` to start dwm, add the script to it:
     ```sh
     nano ~/.dwm/autostart.sh
     ```
   - Add the following line before `exec dwm`:
     ```sh
     ~/set-touchpad-speed.sh &
     exec dwm
     ```

   - If you start dwm via another method, you can add the script to your session's autostart configuration.

By following these steps, you should be able to adjust and persistently set your touchpad pointer speed in dwm. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
