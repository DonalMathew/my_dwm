To temporarily turn off your screen in **dwm** (and have it turn back on with a keyboard press or touchpad movement), you can use tools like `xset` to control the display's power settings. Here's how to do it:

### Step 1: Use `xset` to Turn Off the Screen

The `xset` command can control screen power (DPMS) and screensaver settings. It can turn off your screen temporarily and then automatically turn it back on when you press a key or move the mouse/touchpad.

1. **Turn off the screen immediately** using `xset`:
   ```bash
   xset dpms force off
   ```

   This command turns off the display, and it will automatically turn back on when you press a key, move the mouse, or touch the touchpad.

### Step 2: Optional â€” Bind a Key in `dwm` to Turn Off the Screen

To make it more convenient, you can bind a key in `dwm` to quickly turn off the screen. Follow these steps:

1. **Open your `dwm` configuration file (`config.h`)**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/dwm
   nano config.h
   ```

2. **Add a keybinding** for turning off the screen:
   Find the section in `config.h` where keybindings are defined, and add the following line:
   
   ```c
   { MODKEY, XK_F12, spawn, SHCMD("xset dpms force off") },
   ```

   Replace `MODKEY` with the modifier key you're using in `dwm` (typically `Mod4Mask` for the Super/Windows key, or `Mod1Mask` for Alt), and `XK_F12` with your preferred key if you want something other than `F12`.

3. **Recompile `dwm`**:
   After making changes, recompile `dwm`:

   ```bash
   sudo make clean install
   ```

4. **Restart `dwm`**:
   You can restart `dwm` by logging out and back in, or by restarting `dwm` directly:
   ```bash
   killall dwm
   ```

Now, pressing the defined key combination (e.g., `Mod + F12`) will turn off the screen. The screen will turn back on when you press a key, touch the touchpad, or move the mouse.

### Step 3: Adjust DPMS Settings for Screen Sleep (Optional)

If you want your screen to automatically turn off after a certain period of inactivity, you can adjust the DPMS (Display Power Management Signaling) settings with `xset`:

1. **Set DPMS timeout** (in seconds):
   ```bash
   xset dpms 300 300 300
   ```
   This will automatically put the display into standby, suspend, and off mode after 5 minutes (300 seconds) of inactivity.

### Conclusion

By using `xset dpms force off`, you can easily turn off your OLED screen temporarily to avoid burn-in issues. Adding a keybinding in `dwm` makes this even more convenient. The screen will turn back on as soon as you press any key or move the touchpad/mouse.
