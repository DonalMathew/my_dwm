To connect to a Wi-Fi network using the Linux terminal, you can follow these steps. The process may vary slightly depending on the tools available on your distribution, but here are the general steps using `nmcli` and `wpa_supplicant`.

### Method 1: Using `nmcli`

1. **Open Terminal**.

2. **Identify Your Wireless Interface**:
   ```bash
   nmcli device
   ```
   Look for your wireless device, typically named something like `wlan0` or `wlp3s0`.

3. **Enable Wi-Fi** (if itâ€™s not already enabled):
   ```bash
   nmcli radio wifi on
   ```

4. **Scan for Available Networks**:
   ```bash
   nmcli device wifi list
   ```

5. **Connect to the Wi-Fi Network**:
   Replace `<SSID>` with your network name and `<password>` with your Wi-Fi password:
   ```bash
   nmcli dev wifi connect <SSID> password <password>
   ```

6. **Verify Connection**:
   You can check the connection status with:
   ```bash
   nmcli connection show --active
   ```

### Method 2: Using `wpa_supplicant`

1. **Install `wpa_supplicant`** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt install wpasupplicant
   ```

2. **Identify Your Wireless Interface**:
   ```bash
   iwconfig
   ```
   Note the name of your wireless interface (e.g., `wlp4s0`).

3. **Bring Up the Wireless Interface**:
   ```bash
   sudo ip link set dev wlp4s0 up
   ```

4. **Create a Configuration File**:
   Use the following command to create a configuration file for your network:
   ```bash
   wpa_passphrase <SSID> <password> | sudo tee /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
   ```

5. **Connect to the Network**:
   Run the following command to connect using `wpa_supplicant`:
   ```bash
   sudo wpa_supplicant -B -i wlp4s0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
   ```

6. **Obtain an IP Address**:
   After connecting, obtain an IP address with:
   ```bash
   sudo dhclient wlp4s0
   ```

7. **Verify Connection**:
   You can check if you are connected by pinging a website:
   ```bash
   ping -c 4 google.com
   ```

### Conclusion

These methods allow you to connect to Wi-Fi networks directly from the terminal in Linux. The `nmcli` method is generally simpler and more user-friendly, while `wpa_supplicant` provides more control and is useful in environments without a graphical interface.
