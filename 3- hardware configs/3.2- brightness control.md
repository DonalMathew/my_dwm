### Method 2: Using `brightnessctl`

`brightnessctl` is a more versatile tool for managing brightness.

1. **Install `brightnessctl`**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install brightnessctl
   ```

2. **Adjust Brightness**:
   - Increase brightness by 10%:
     ```sh
     sudo brightnessctl set +10%
     ```
   - Decrease brightness by 10%:
     ```sh
     sudo brightnessctl set 10%-
     ```
   - Set brightness to a specific value (e.g., 50%):
     ```sh
     sudo brightnessctl set 50%
     ```
