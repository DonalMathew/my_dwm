>**in a nutshell:** just move the executable file into `~/bin`(or the locations returned by the command `echo $PATH`) 


>move the folder of application to `/opt`(a place where all the user app files are stored)
i created an app for whatsapp as the file in this folder, which is a hard way but works and with firefox.

the "8.2 desktop" is the simplest method ,is not yet made working, and even if made working, works with only chrome.
