To configure brightness control using **`brightnessctl`** in **dwm** and resize windows in **dwm**, follow these steps:

---

### Part 1: Configure Brightness Control Using `brightnessctl`

`brightnessctl` allows you to control screen brightness through the terminal. You can bind brightness adjustment to specific keys in **dwm**.

#### Step 1: Install `brightnessctl`

If you donâ€™t already have `brightnessctl` installed, install it using:

```bash
sudo apt install brightnessctl
```

#### Step 2: Add Keybindings for Brightness Control in `dwm`

1. **Open your `dwm` configuration file (`config.h`)**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/dwm
   nano config.h
   ```

2. **Add Keybindings for Brightness Control**:
   Find the section where keybindings are defined (usually inside the `static Key keys[] = {` array). Add the following lines to control brightness:

   ```c
   { 0, XF86XK_MonBrightnessUp,   spawn, SHCMD("brightnessctl set +10%") },
   { 0, XF86XK_MonBrightnessDown, spawn, SHCMD("brightnessctl set 10%-") },
   ```

   - `XF86XK_MonBrightnessUp` and `XF86XK_MonBrightnessDown` are the keys for brightness control (usually present on laptop keyboards).
   - If your keyboard lacks brightness keys, you can use other key combinations, like `Mod + F5` for brightness down and `Mod + F6` for brightness up:
   
   ```c
   { MODKEY, XK_F5, spawn, SHCMD("brightnessctl set 10%-") },
   { MODKEY, XK_F6, spawn, SHCMD("brightnessctl set +10%") },
   ```

3. **Include the Header for Special Keys**:
   Make sure the header for XF86 keys is included at the top of the file:

   ```c
   #include <X11/XF86keysym.h>
   ```

4. **Rebuild and Restart `dwm`**:
   After modifying the configuration, recompile `dwm`:

   ```bash
   sudo make clean install
   ```

   Restart `dwm` to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   killall dwm
   ```

Now, you should be able to control the brightness using the designated keys.
