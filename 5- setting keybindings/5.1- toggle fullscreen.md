To make a tiled window full screen in `dwm`, you need to utilize the floating layout and toggle the full screen. Here are the steps to achieve this:

### Step 1: Identify the Keybinding for Fullscreen

By default, `dwm` does not have a dedicated keybinding for fullscreen, but you can modify the `config.h` file to include one. Typically, you can use the floating layout to achieve a similar effect.

### Step 2: Modify `config.h` to Add a Fullscreen Keybinding

1. **Navigate to the `dwm` source directory**:
   ```sh
   cd path/to/dwm
   ```

2. **Open the `config.h` file** with your preferred text editor:
   ```sh
   nano config.h
   ```

3. **Add a fullscreen toggle function**:
   Add the following function definition before the `keys` array:

   ```c
   void togglefullscr(const Arg *arg) {
       if(selmon->sel) {
           setfullscreen(selmon->sel, !selmon->sel->isfullscreen);
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Add the keybinding for fullscreen**:
   Add a new entry to the `keys` array to bind a key combination for toggling fullscreen. For example, to bind it to `MODKEY + f`:

   ```c
   { MODKEY,                       XK_f,      togglefullscr,  {0} },
   ```

5. **Ensure the fullscreen function is declared**:
   Add the following declaration at the beginning of `config.h`:

   ```c
   void togglefullscr(const Arg *arg);
   ```

### Step 3: Rebuild and Restart `dwm`

After editing the `config.h` file, you need to rebuild and restart `dwm` for the changes to take effect.

1. **Rebuild `dwm`**:
   ```sh
   sudo make clean install
   ```

2. **Restart `dwm`**:
   - If you are running `dwm` from a terminal using `startx`, simply restart `startx`.
   - If `dwm` is managed by a display manager, log out and log back in.

### Step 4: Use the Keybinding to Toggle Fullscreen

After rebuilding and restarting `dwm`, you can now use the keybinding `MODKEY + f` to toggle fullscreen mode for the focused window.

### Summary

1. **Locate and edit `config.h`**:
   ```sh
   cd path/to/dwm
   nano config.h
   ```

2. **Add the fullscreen toggle function and keybinding**:

   - Function definition:
     ```c
     void togglefullscr(const Arg *arg) {
         if(selmon->sel) {
             setfullscreen(selmon->sel, !selmon->sel->isfullscreen);
         }
     }
     ```

   - Keybinding:
     ```c
     { MODKEY,                       XK_f,      togglefullscr,  {0} },
     ```

   - Function declaration:
     ```c
     void togglefullscr(const Arg *arg);
     ```

3. **Rebuild and restart `dwm`**:
   ```sh
   sudo make clean install
   ```

4. **Use `MODKEY + f`** to toggle fullscreen.

By following these steps, you can make a tiled window fullscreen in `dwm`. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
